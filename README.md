# Drought Tolerance in Tropical Tree Species
_Statistical analysis, comparing linear models to examine potential differences in drought tolerance based on taxonomic family_

## Background
Climate change, in conjunction with other environmental stressors, continue to threaten forests around the world. Mass tree deaths, fires, and deforestation can create a negative feedback loop, turning these carbon sinks into a source. Forests are also recognized for their role in preventing erosion, filtering air pollution, and providing habitat and recreation for people and wildlife alike. Droughts have been proven to adversely affect forest health. Minimal and inconsistent water supply affects phenology and increases the chance of insect outbreaks or wildfires. I was curious to learn more about how forests impacted tropical species, which I presume would be far less adapted to severe weather fluctuations.
